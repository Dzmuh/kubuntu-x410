## How to work with it

Install [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), ha ha.

May be so...

```bash
sudo snap install powershell --classic
```

Current stable version PowerShell not work on Kbuntu 20.04. At the moment, the problem is solved so:

```bash
sudo snap install powershell-preview --classic
alias pwsh=pwsh-preview
```

Make the install script executable and run them...

```bash
sudo chmod +x install.ps1
```
